////////////////////
// Initial Page Load
////////////////////

- get data from API

- insert link tags requesting fonts into <head /> (enough to fill at least a page, initial page load so in order of popularity)

- render font cards for these (once corresponding fonts are confirmed to have loaded)

- lazy load font cards as user scrolls down page (insert new link tags into <head /> and make corresponding font cards visible once fonts are confirmed to have loaded)



//////////////////
// Search / Filter
//////////////////

- filter font list based on input text

- render font cards based on filtered list with example text hidden/transparent for any which have not yet been loaded

- insert link tags to request fonts for any cards that do not have corresponding link tags already in head

- make example text in corresponding cards visible once confirmed that corresponding fonts have loaded




***********************************

In state we'll have an array for the full list of fonts from API plus a second array which cards will be rendered from.

The second list will be updated on change event for search input based on input text.

If search input is empty on change event either render from first array (full font list) or filter function will just return array matching full list.
